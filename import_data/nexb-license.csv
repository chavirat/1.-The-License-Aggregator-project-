ANTLR automates the construction of language recognizers. From a formal grammar, ANTLR generates a program that determines whether sentences conform to that language. In other words, it's a program that writes other programs. By adding code snippets to the grammar, the recognizer becomes a translator or interpreter. ANTLR provides excellent support for intermediate-form tree construction, tree walking, translation and provides sophisticated automatic error recovery and reporting. 

There are currently about 5,000 ANTLR source downloads a month and is included on all Linux and OS X distributions. ANTLR is widely used because it's easy to understand, powerful, flexible, generates human-readable output, comes with complete source under the BSD license, is actively supported, and usually allows you to write actions in your favorite language.

ANTLR v3 is a completely rewritten version and is the culmination of nearly 20 years of experience building language tools. The goal of version 3 was to provide a really clean source base and to significantly clean up the syntax and semantics of the ANTLR grammar meta-language. While there are significant enhancements based upon new and exciting research, the tool retains its strong mojo and should feel very familiar to ANTLR v2 users. See What is the difference between ANTLR v2 and v3? The core tool is written by Terence Parr, the lunatic behind the previous two versions. v3 took four years of frantic coding and research effort (please see credit). 

Terence Parr is the maniac behind ANTLR and has been working on ANTLR since 1989. He is a professor of computer science at the University of San Francisco. Together with his colleagues, Terence has made a number of fundamental contributions to parsing theory and language tool construction, leading to the resurgence of LL(k)-based recognition tools. "

Cryptography programming
We maintain a detailed cryptography software page with useful free cryptographic software code and various articles on cryptography. The free code includes the Blowfish algorithm in VB6 and the MySecret command-line freeware encryption utility. The articles include our page on the RSA Algorithm including the Theory and proof of the RSA algorithm, and various how-to pages such as Using Keys in Cryptography, Using Padding in Encryption, Encryption with International Character Sets (re-written 2010-08-28), and Cross-Platform Encryption. We also publish cryptography-related articles on Mathematics. 

CryptoSys Products
We sell two commercial cryptographic products under the CryptoSysTM brand name: CryptoSys API and the CryptoSys PKI Toolkit. CryptoSys API is library of symmetrical cryptography tools and the CryptoSys PKI Toolkit provides public key encryption and digital signatures. FirmaSAT is an add-on to CryptoSys PKI to create and read digital receipts for the Tax Administration Service in Mexico (SAT). There are interfaces for programmers in VB6/VBA, VB.NET/VB2005/VB2008, C/C++, C# and (for CryptoSys API) ActiveX/COM/VBScript.

CoIT is the introduction into the enterprise, planned and otherwise, of devices that were designed as consumer technologies: tablets, smart phones, and social media are classic examples.

Byte is here to examine technology in the context of CoIT. The subject relates closely to important IT issues like security and manageability. It's an issue that reaches both IT and users, and it's an issue where both groups need to listen carefully to the requirements of the other: IT may wish to hold off on allowing devices and software onto the network when they haven't been properly tested and can't be properly supported. But the use of these devices in the enterprise has the air of inevitability for a good reason. They make users more productive and users are demanding them.

We intend to help you find the middle ground. You can expect relevant content on important matters in Byte. We're not just another technology site.

Our participation in open source has led to great results that might never have happened otherwise, both in community building and in actual software development. In the process, we have had in-depth discussions with many different people about pivotal interactions between open source, business, and legal issues. Of these issues, the thorniest relate to patents. Whether you love or hate patents, they exist and have an impact that open source projects cannot avoid.

At CERN, the worlds largest and most complex scientific instruments are used to study the basic constituents of matter  the fundamental particles. By studying what happens when these particles collide, physicists learn about the laws of Nature.

The instruments used at CERN are particle accelerators and detectors. Accelerators boost beams of particles to high energies before they are made to collide with each other or with stationary targets. Detectors observe and record the results of these collisions.

Together with our licensing, support and services capabilities, we operate with the mission to work closely with developers to ensure that their Qt projects are deployed on time, within budget and with a competitive advantage.

Background of Qt
Qt (cute) is a leading cross-platform application and UI development framework for all the major desktop, embedded and mobile operating systems. Qt uses standard C++ and is widely used for developing software applications with a GUI and also for developing non-GUI applications with features such as file handling, database access, XML parsing, thread management and network support. Qts powerful full-framework capabilities allows for the creation of highly-performing native applications as well as for hybrid development where the developer can choose which tools provide the best user experience.

Our Goal
Qt is created by developers for developers where making developers lives easier is top priority. We strive to provide an incomparable developer experience with the tools necessary to create amazing user experiences. Qt is platform agnostic and believes in making sure that all developers are privy of being able to target multiple platforms with one framework by simply reusing code. We believe in providing freedom to the developer. Code less. Create more. Deploy everywhere."

The Eclipse Foundation is a not-for-profit, member supported corporation that hosts the Eclipse projects and helps cultivate both an open source community and an ecosystem of complementary products and services.

The Eclipse Project was originally created by IBM in November 2001 and supported by a consortium of software vendors. The Eclipse Foundation was created in January 2004 as an independent not-for-profit corporation to act as the steward of the Eclipse community. The independent not-for-profit corporation was created to allow a vendor neutral and open, transparent community to be established around Eclipse. Today, the Eclipse community consists of individuals and organizations from a cross section of the software industry.

The Eclipse Foundation is funded by annual dues from our members and governed by a Board of Directors. Strategic Developers and Strategic Consumers hold seats on this Board, as do representatives elected by Add-in Providers and Open Source committers. The Foundation employs a full-time professional staff to provide services to the community but does not employ the open source developers, called committers, which actually work on the Eclipse projects. Eclipse committers are typically employed by organizations or are independent developers that volunteer their time to work on an open source project.

In general, the Eclipse Foundation provides four services to the Eclipse community: 1) IT Infrastructure, 2) IP Management,3) Development Process, and 4) Ecosystem Development. Full-time staff are associated with each of these areas and work with the greater Eclipse community to assist in meeting the needs of the stakeholders."

Stallman,"from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman 

Richard Matthew Stallman (born March 16, 1953), often known by his initials, rms,[1] is a software freedom activist and computer programmer. He campaigns for software to be distributed in a manner such that its users receive the freedoms to use, study, distribute and modify that software. Software that ensures these freedoms (as rights that are granted, when obtaining[2] the software) is termed free software. He is best known for launching the GNU Project, founding the Free Software Foundation, developing the GNU Compiler Collection and GNU Emacs, and writing the GNU General Public License.

Stallman launched the GNU Project in September 1983 to create a Unix-like computer operating system composed entirely of free software.[3] With this, he also launched the free software movement. He has been the GNU project's lead architect and organizer, and developed a number of pieces of widely used GNU software including, among others, the GNU Compiler Collection,[4] the GNU Debugger[5] and the GNU Emacs text editor.[6] In October 1985[7] he founded the Free Software Foundation.

Stallman pioneered the concept of copyleft, which uses the principles of copyright law to preserve the right to use, modify and distribute free software, and is the main author of free software licenses which describe those terms, most notably the GNU General Public License (GPL), the most widely used free software license.[8]

In 1989 he co-founded the League for Programming Freedom. Since the mid-1990s, Stallman has spent most of his time advocating for free software, as well as campaigning against software patents, digital rights management, and other legal and technical systems which he sees as taking away users' freedoms, including software license agreements, non-disclosure agreements, activation keys, dongles, copy restriction, proprietary formats and binary executables without source code.

As of 2014, he has received fifteen honorary doctorates and professorships."

Affero hosts personal web pages for authors, whether they are bloggers, writers, publishers, community hosts or individual forum participants that describe why they care about certain issues, which causes or organizations they feel need support, and a secured payment mechanism to facilitate impulse gifts from patrons who the member may have inspired or assisted in time of need. Affero also provides a historical record of ratings for the authors and their patrons. Each members' user-history provides a record of their contributions as perceived by other community members, including their history of writing, volunteerism and partronage. The personal web pages each have a unique web address (URL) that members can attach to email signatures, blog entries, articles, bulletin boards or any other digital work. All Affero members build community reputations through various interactions. Over time, these reputations can help facilitate a better understanding of the impact of an authors works, and hopefully inspire more effective dialogue for members in new and existing communities. 

Affero, Inc., endorses the development and use of Free Software. Founded in 2001, Affero is a privately held company headquartered in San Francisco, CA. 

The Affero project is supported by CivicActions, a Drupal consultancy.

It detects and removes unused classes, fields, methods, and attributes. It optimizes bytecode and removes unused instructions. It renames the remaining classes, fields, and methods using short meaningless names. Finally, it preverifies the processed code for Java 6 or higher, or for Java Micro Edition.

Some uses of ProGuard are:
Creating more compact code, for smaller code archives, faster transfer across networks, faster loading, and smaller memory footprints.
Making programs and libraries harder to reverse-engineer.
Listing dead code, so it can be removed from the source code.
Retargeting and preverifying existing class files for Java 6 or higher, to take full advantage of their faster class loading.
ProGuard's main advantage compared to other Java obfuscators is probably its compact template-based configuration. A few intuitive command line options or a simple configuration file are usually sufficient. The user manual explains all available options and shows examples of this powerful configuration style.

ProGuard is fast. It only takes seconds to process programs and libraries of several megabytes. The results section presents actual figures for a number of applications.

ProGuard is a command-line tool with an optional graphical user interface. It also comes with plugins for Ant, for Gradle, and for the JME Wireless Toolkit."

Conversely, SELinux access controls are determined by a policy loaded on the system which may not be changed by careless users or misbehaving applications.
SELinux also adds finer granularity to access controls. Instead of only being able to specify who can read, write or execute a file, for example, SELinux lets you specify who can unlink, append only, move a file and so on.

Theodoros Karounos initially contacted Panayiotis Sidiropoulos suggesting that some fonts be released as free software. After the company's positive reaction to this proposal, these fonts were selected by Alexios Zavras from Magenta's extensive font portfolio. Zenon Mousmoulas processed the legal issues concerning the fonts and their licensing terms; after negotiating with the company's legal counsel and reaching an agreement, Magenta executives officially announced their intention to release the particular fonts as free software, at the same time asking for help in accomplishing this goal. Alexios Zavras made the first round of corrections and additions, and transformed the fonts in modern encodings and file formats. Konstantinos Margaritis has subsequently undertaken the task of adopting the fonts for their inclusion in Debian GNU/Linux.

It was decided to release the fonts under a license closely modeled after the one used by Bitstream Inc. and GNOME Foundation for the Bitstream Vera fonts. This license provides users with almost unlimited freedom, essentially giving them the right to modify and redistribute the fonts as long as each font is not sold separately and that variations and derivatives will not be distributed under the same name (MgOpen)."

On the theoretical side I have been interested in time-series methods and the use of large sample (asymptotic) methods in unusual situations. In these interests, I have been very much influenced by my first co-author, Professor David Vere-Jones, and by my graduate advisers Professors Jerzy Neyman and Lucien LeCam at Berkeley. And then by clients and colleagues in DSIR.

Some of my work has involved the manipulation of matrices and I have dreamed of a computer language that would allow the simple manipulation of matrices without the overheads and awkwardness of the standard statistical computing languages and the awkwardness in handling matrices in the regular computing languages. C++ seemed to allow the possibility of writing a nice matrix package, but it was much more complicated than I ever dreamed it would be.

Most of my real statistical analysis used to be carried out in the S-plus statistical language with help from Excel, Access and SQL server. However I do see a place for a statistical package embedded in C++ and am now carrying out some of my work in a preliminary version of this package.

Some of my recent work is involving getting data from quite large databases then using S-plus to get conclusions for clients. This involves both presenting the data graphically and using standard statistical analysis methods. I see this as an important area for new research: particularly, how do you do EDA graphics plus analyses such as fitting generalised linear models on these large databases?

ADVISORY COUNCIL
See the Advisory Council page.

HISTORY
In December 2007 Open Data Commons was created by Jordan Hatcher as the home for the drafting of the first ever open database license: the Public Domain Dedication and License. The license was written by Jordan Hatcher and Dr Charlotte Waelde with their work funded by Talis.

Seeking a more long-term home for this endeavour, in January 2009 Jordan transferred the Open Data Commons project to the Open Knowledge Foundation. While the Foundation is responsible for hosting ODC and running it on a day-to-day basis, ultimate responsibility for management and drafting of the licenses (plus associated material) lies with the Advisory Council.

It runs on all major operating systems, including Linux, UNIX (AIX, BSD, HP-UX, SGI IRIX, Mac OS X, Solaris, Tru64), and Windows. It is fully ACID compliant, has full support for foreign keys, joins, views, triggers, and stored procedures (in multiple languages). It includes most SQL:2008 data types, including INTEGER, NUMERIC, BOOLEAN, CHAR, VARCHAR, DATE, INTERVAL, and TIMESTAMP. It also supports storage of binary large objects, including pictures, sounds, or video. It has native programming interfaces for C/C++, Java, .Net, Perl, Python, Ruby, Tcl, ODBC, among others, and exceptional documentation.

An enterprise class database, PostgreSQL boasts sophisticated features such as Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC), point in time recovery, tablespaces, asynchronous replication, nested transactions (savepoints), online/hot backups, a sophisticated query planner/optimizer, and write ahead logging for fault tolerance. It supports international character sets, multibyte character encodings, Unicode, and it is locale-aware for sorting, case-sensitivity, and formatting. It is highly scalable both in the sheer quantity of data it can manage and in the number of concurrent users it can accommodate. There are active PostgreSQL systems in production environments that manage in excess of 4 terabytes of data."

ADVISORY COUNCIL
See the Advisory Council page.

HISTORY
In December 2007 Open Data Commons was created by Jordan Hatcher as the home for the drafting of the first ever open database license: the Public Domain Dedication and License. The license was written by Jordan Hatcher and Dr Charlotte Waelde with their work funded by Talis.

Seeking a more long-term home for this endeavour, in January 2009 Jordan transferred the Open Data Commons project to the Open Knowledge Foundation. While the Foundation is responsible for hosting ODC and running it on a day-to-day basis, ultimate responsibility for management and drafting of the licenses (plus associated material) lies with the Advisory Council.

Background of Qt
Qt (cute) is a leading cross-platform application and UI development framework for all the major desktop, embedded and mobile operating systems. Qt uses standard C++ and is widely used for developing software applications with a GUI and also for developing non-GUI applications with features such as file handling, database access, XML parsing, thread management and network support. Qts powerful full-framework capabilities allows for the creation of highly-performing native applications as well as for hybrid development where the developer can choose which tools provide the best user experience.

Our Goal
Qt is created by developers for developers where making developers lives easier is top priority. We strive to provide an incomparable developer experience with the tools necessary to create amazing user experiences. Qt is platform agnostic and believes in making sure that all developers are privy of being able to target multiple platforms with one framework by simply reusing code. We believe in providing freedom to the developer. Code less. Create more. Deploy everywhere."

Nuance Communications is a multinational computer software technology corporation, headquartered in Burlington, Massachusetts, USA, that provides speech and imaging applications. Current business products focus on server & embedded speech recognition, telephone call steering systems, automated telephone directory services, medical transcription software & systems, optical character recognition software, and desktop imaging software. The company also maintains a small division which does software and system development for military and government agencies. In October 2011, unconfirmed research suggested that its servers power Apple's iPhone 4S Siri voice recognition application.

As of 2008, the company is a result of organic growth, mergers, and acquisitions. Most notable was the &quot;merger&quot; of ScanSoft and Nuance in October 2005. Before the merger, the two companies competed in the commercial large scale speech application business. The officially termed &quot;merger&quot; was a de facto acquisition of Nuance by ScanSoft, though the combined company changed its name to Nuance following the transaction. Before 1999, ScanSoft was known as Visioneer, a hardware and software scanner company. In 1999, Visioneer bought ScanSoft  a Xerox spin-off  and adopted ScanSoft as the company name. The original ScanSoft had its roots in Kurzweil Computer Products, a software company that developed the first omni-font character recognition system."

Nuance Communications is a multinational computer software technology corporation, headquartered in Burlington, Massachusetts, USA, that provides speech and imaging applications. Current business products focus on server & embedded speech recognition, telephone call steering systems, automated telephone directory services, medical transcription software & systems, optical character recognition software, and desktop imaging software. The company also maintains a small division which does software and system development for military and government agencies. In October 2011, unconfirmed research suggested that its servers power Apple's iPhone 4S Siri voice recognition application.

As of 2008, the company is a result of organic growth, mergers, and acquisitions. Most notable was the &quot;merger&quot; of ScanSoft and Nuance in October 2005. Before the merger, the two companies competed in the commercial large scale speech application business. The officially termed &quot;merger&quot; was a de facto acquisition of Nuance by ScanSoft, though the combined company changed its name to Nuance following the transaction. Before 1999, ScanSoft was known as Visioneer, a hardware and software scanner company. In 1999, Visioneer bought ScanSoft  a Xerox spin-off  and adopted ScanSoft as the company name. The original ScanSoft had its roots in Kurzweil Computer Products, a software company that developed the first omni-font character recognition system."

Many people know my name from the Postfix open source mail server, and from the Coroner's Toolkit, written with Dan Farmer, primarily for the post-mortem analysis of computer break-ins. I wrote these at the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center, in the USA, where I currently work.

Older widely-known software includes TCP Wrapper, and SATAN (written with Dan Farmer). I wrote these while I lived in the Netherlands.

I was inducted into the ISSA hall of fame in 2012, awarded the 2008 Free Software Foundation award in 2009, an IBM technical accomplishment in 2007, a Sendmail innovation award in 2006, the NLUUG Award 2000 in recognition of outstanding achievements for the users of UNIX and Open Systems, the SAGE 1999 outstanding achievement award, and the security summit hall of fame award in 1998.

I completed my 2+ year term as chair of the FIRST, an international association of computer security teams with over 150 members world-wide in government, industry, and academia.

Previous life

In a previous life I studied physics at Groningen University in the Netherlands, where I did my Ph.D. dissertation on work done at the KVI.

I spent 12 years at Eindhoven University, the Netherlands, as systems architect at the Mathematics and Computing Science department. For 8 years, part of that time was devoted to writing tools for automated translation of EDI (Electronic Data Interchange) messages. The result of this effort lives on under the flag of Descartes.

Unlike the LZW compression method used in Unix compress(1) and in the GIF image format, the compression method currently used in zlib essentially never expands the data.

zlib was written by Jean-loup Gailly (compression) and Mark Adler (decompression).
